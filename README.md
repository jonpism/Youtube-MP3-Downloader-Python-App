# Youtube-MP3-Downloader-Python-App
I built a customtkinter app where you put a youtube video link and it downloads the mp3 format of the video (for linux versions only).

How to use/run:

You can run the main.py file anywhere, in any editor you want. Copy and paste any Youtube video link you want,
press the Download button and wait a few seconds until your mp3 file has downloaded in Downloads folder.

If the download is successful, a message pops up and a button to open the Downloads folder,
where your mp3 file is located.
